## 🚀 Features

**Dynamic Location Validation:** We detect Staff's latitude, longitude, and radius for attendance sessions.

**Student Registration:** Students register once with their unique registration number.

**Real-Time Tracking:** Attendance automatically appears on the staff portal once the student reaches within the provided radius.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, responsive web pages for staff and students.

## 🗺️ How It Works

**Staff Portal (host.html):**
Staff enters a location and radius → generates a unique attendance link.

**Stundent Registration**
The attendance of students who have already logged in are marked automatically once they reach the radius.

**Attendance Recording:**
If the student is within the valid radius, attendance is marked and reflected in real-time on the staff portal.
