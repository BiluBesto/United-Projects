  <h1>Location-Based Attendance System</h1>
</p>

Welcome to the **LOCATION BASED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM**!  
This project is an intelligent attendance solution that leverages geolocation to mark user attendance only when they are within one of four predefined sets of coordinates (locations).

- **Key Feature:** Attendance can only be marked when the user's device is detected within any one of the authorized coordinate sets.
- **Audience:** Suitable for colleges, offices, field staff tracking, events, or any scenario requiring location-based verification.

## 🚀 Features

- **Geolocation Validation:** Only marks attendance if user is within the allowed coordinate sets.
- **Configurable Locations:** Four location sets are hardcoded or can be configured.

- **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use prompts for users to attempt marking attendance.
- **Attendance Logs:** Keeps track of successful attendance records.

## 🗺️ How It Works

1. **User Authentication:**  
   User logs in or identifies themselves.

2. **Location Check:**  
   The system fetches the user's current location (latitude, longitude).

3. **Verification:**  
   If the user's coordinates match any of the four authorized sets (within a small margin for GPS accuracy), attendance is marked.

4. **Record:**  
   The attendance is logged for that user.
