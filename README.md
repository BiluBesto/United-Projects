## 🗺️ How It Works

**Staff Portal (host.html):**
Staff enters a location and radius → generates a unique attendance link.

**Link Sharing:**
The attendance link is shared with students.

**Student Portal (student.html):**
Students open the link → enter registration number → system validates their current location.

**Attendance Recording:**
If the student is within the valid radius, attendance is marked and reflected in real-time on the staff portal.
